# bnse
## BeamNG Script Extender

bnse is a mod for [BeamNG.drive](http://www.beamng.com/), extending the existing Lua functionality, making it easier to write mods for the game. It also aims to keep some of the difficult-but-commonly-used code in one place, making it easier to maintain and keep mods up to date as the game progresses. See the wiki for documentation on what bnse adds.
