# bnse

## BeamNG Script Extender

bnse is a mod for [BeamNG.drive](http://www.beamng.com/), extending the existing Lua functionality, making it easier to write mods for the game. It also aims to keep some of the difficult-but-commonly-used code in one place, making it easier to maintain and keep mods up to date as the game progresses.

## Functionality

bnse adds code to both the game engine Lua (GE) and vehicle Lua, along with some extensions for scenarios.

### Game Engine Lua

* [Events](Game-Engine-Events.md)
